Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Subham Mukherjee
Dynamic Programming
1. Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion
2. The idea is to store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later
3. How to improve the space and time complexity of an algorithm
